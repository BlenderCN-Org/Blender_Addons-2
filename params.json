  "body": "# Edit Strip with Compositor\r\nThe color grading and compositing features in the VSE are rudimentary while Blender comes with a great nodal compositor that cannot be used in the sequencer directly. What a pity!\r\nThis addon tries to unleash Blender's great grading capabilities by offering a way to grade sequencer clips in the nodal compositor.\r\nA more detailed description will follow!\r\n\r\n# Sun Tools\r\n## Movie Manager\r\nDedicated NLEs provide a way to manage your video material before adding the clips to the timeline. Blender does not allow this, but using the SunTools Movie Manager Addon you are able to view and trim your clips before adding them and you can even sort out clips that are not usable by hiding them in the file manager.\r\nIt works with one Blender Window but is actually designed to be used with a dual monitor setup: Duplicate the Window in Blender's info header so that you end up with two windows, each showing your timeline setup. Now you can add a file manager section to one of them and use that window to pretrim your clips and then add them to your main timeline in the other window using the operators in the plugin.\r\nThere is also an option to insert those trimmed strips as a metastrip with combined audio and video.\r\n\r\n## TrimTools\r\nTrimming strips and navigating through the timeline is not really comfortable. For example there are many situations which demand for a way to move and trim clips quickly and precisely in relation to each other and to the playhead (for example if a clip should start exactly after the previous one ends).\r\n\r\nThe SunTools Addon provides a second section called TrimTools.\r\nIt enhances the efficiency of trimming and cutting clips in the timeline by providing operators to trim a clip's starting- or endpoint to the current playhead position.\r\nYou can also select a video strip and it's according audio strip simultaneously and use a snapping operator that works in analogy to the Blender's one, moves the strip so that it's endpoint matched the playhead, not it's starting point.\r\n\r\n# Highpass \r\nBlender has got a great tracking tool, which can also be used to compensate unwanted camera movements. A common use case is represented by the intention to make a shaky handheld video look stable.\r\nThough if you try to deshake a video you will encounter the Problem that the algorithm compensates all camera movement. This is fine if you are going to stabilize a steady shot like it is shown in the tutorial above, but in most cases there is some intended movement like a camera pan that should be preserved while annoying jittering needs to be removed.\r\n\r\nTo make this kind of selective video stabilization possible I have written a small addon which applies a rudimentary highpass filter to a selected tracking marker. After the filter is applied, only the fast, jittering moves are represented by the marker so that you can use it to get much better stabilization results!\r\n\r\nUsing the addon is very simple:\r\nFind a good feature and track it, just like in the tutorial.\r\nWhen you have done this, select the marker and use the addon whose UI is located on the bottom of the Clip Editor's tool panel.\r\n\r\nThe numeric value represents the range of frames over which the motion is smoothed. A higher value makes slower motions being stabilized, too. Usually a value between 5 and 15 gives good results.\r\nThe Apply operator filters the selected marker in the scene's frame range (the start and end frame that are found in the timeline window's header).\r\nPlease make sure that the marker is tracked/keyframed for every frame in that range; otherwise the addon will fail.\r\n\r\nNow a second trackpoint is created. Simply use it for 2d stabilization instead of the original track.\r\nYou can also repeat the procedure for a second track point and use it for rotation stabilization!\r\n\r\n# Natronizer\r\nBecause it is my favorite application for editing Videos, but the internal (quite powerful) Node compositor is too slow for Visual Effects Work and complex color grading, I have decided to use Natron for that and thus try to integrate it into the Blender editing workflow.\r\n\r\nIt works in a similiar way as the edit Strip with Blender compositor Addon:\r\nYou will find a new Section in the Sequencer panel w named \"Natronizer\". Make sure to enter the correct Paths to your Natron and NatronRenderer executables.\r\n- Clicking in Natronize will create an Imagestrip, which is associated with a natron Project, above every selected movie Strip. Natron will open and then close immediately when the Natronize Button is pressed. The reason behind this is that Natron is only started to setup the Natron project for the strip. As soon as that is done Natron is closed and the new Imagesequence Strip should appear in the Blender Timeline.\r\nThe Edit Button opens Natron for editing the Project.\r\n- If one of those Imagestrips is selected, the \"Edit\" Button opens a new Natron window where you can edit the composition. Save the Project to apply the changes.\r\n- The render Preview button will render all selected Natron associated Image Strips so that get a preview of the Strips in the Blender Sequencer.\r\n- If the live preview checkbox is activated, natron Image Strips will be rendered for the current frame on framechange. That means that means that, even without having used the render Preview button, the Natron Image Strips will show the composition Result from Natron. There is also an intelligent Caching system: Frames are only re-rendered if the natron Project got changed and otherwise already rendered Frames are used. So if the Checkbox is activated, also Frames of already rendered Strips via render Preview won't be rendered again so you get smooth playback wherever it is possible.\r\nWhen the Project is rendered, all Natron Image Srips are Prerendered before the the actual rendering starts.\r\n\r\nYou may enter a Natron plugin ID into the custom Plugin box. That plugin will be inserted into a new Composition which is created by the Natronize operator.\r\nLeave the field Blank to disable this.\r\n\r\nPlease notice: While frames or strips are rendered (either using the render Preview Button, before Rendering or with live Preview) Blender will freeze until the rendering is finished. This is not an error. To track the rendering progress, start Blender from console where Natron outputs its messages.\r\n",
